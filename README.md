# Weather-App


This project is a simple weather app that provides weather information for different cities. Users can search for a city, view its current weather conditions, and receive relevant weather details.

## Features

1. **City Search**:
   - Users can input a city name in the search bar.
   - The app fetches weather data for the specified city.

2. **Weather Display**:
   - The app displays the following weather information:
     - Current temperature
     - Weather image (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
     - Humidity
     - Wind speed
  

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If an incorrect or invalid city name is entered, the app displays an error message asking the user to enter a valid city.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - CSS styles ensure a pleasant user experience across different screen sizes.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter a city name in the search bar and press Enter.
4. View the weather details for the specified city.

## How It Works

- The `index.html` file contains the structure of the weather app.
- The `styles.css` file provides styling rules for the app components.
- The `script.js` file handles the logic for fetching weather data from an API and displaying it to the user.
